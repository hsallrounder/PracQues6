Q1. Write a recursive function to convert a decimal no into a binary no, print the binary number.


Q2. Design a method that returns true if element n is a member of given array and false if not by using the recursion


Q3. In a sorted linked list (elements are sorted in ascending order), eliminate duplicates from the given linked list, such that output linked list contains only unique elements.


Q4. Mid Point Linked List

For a given singly linked list of integers, find and return the node present at the middle of the list.

Note : If the length of the singly linked list is even, then return the first middle node.

Example: Consider, 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 is the given list, then the nodes present at the middle with respective data values are, 20 and 30. We return the first node with data 20.
 Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element
 Output Format :
For each test case/query, print the data value of the node at the middle of the given list.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Where M is the size of the singly linked list.

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
1
1 2 3 4 5 -1
Sample Output 1 :
3
Sample Input 2 :
2
-1
1 2 3 4 -1
Sample Output 2 :
2


Q5. Print Reverse LinkedList

You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function to print the list in a reverse order.
To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data at the end.
Note :
You canâ€™t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print it in the reverse order.
 Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
Remember/Constraints :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
Output format :
For each test case, print the singly linked list of integers in a reverse fashion, in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
 Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Sample Input 1 :
1
1 2 3 4 5 -1
Sample Output 1 :
5 4 3 2 1
Sample Input 2 :
2
1 2 3 -1
10 20 30 40 50 -1
Sample Output 2 :
3 2 1
50 40 30 20 10

Note:- try to solve this problem by using the iterative statement  and recursive statement


Q6. Palindrome LinkedList

You have been given a head to a singly linked list of integers. Write a function check to whether the list given is a 'Palindrome' or not.
 Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First and the only line of each test case or query contains the the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
 Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
 Output format :
For each test case, the only line of output that print 'true' if the list is Palindrome or 'false' otherwise.
 Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Sample Input 1 :
1
9 2 3 3 2 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
2
0 2 3 2 5 -1
